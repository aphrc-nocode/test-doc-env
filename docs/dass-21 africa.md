The DASS-21, a 21-item questionnaire, is **used to assess levels of depression, anxiety, and stress**, and research has explored its psychometric properties in various African contexts, finding it to be a valid and reliable tool for assessing these states. \[[1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/view/174532), [2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14330237.2019.1647499), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8385266/), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6751677/)\]

Here's a more detailed look at the DASS-21 and its use in African contexts:

**What is the DASS-21? \[[1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/view/174532), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6751677/), [5](https://f1000research.com/articles/12-229), [6](https://www.scielo.br/j/pusf/a/556FBTT3R47CFgxGqmL4Bbj/?format=pdf#:~:text=The%20DASS%2D21%20was%20developed%20by%20Lovibond%20and,dimensions%20\(Gomez%2C%202013;%20Osman%20et%20al.%2C%202012\).)\]**

* The DASS-21 is a shortened version of the longer DASS-42 scale, designed to assess the three states of depression, anxiety, and stress.  
* It consists of 21 items, divided into three subscales: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress.  
* Each subscale contains seven items, and respondents rate their experiences on a 4-point scale (0=did not apply to me at all to 3 \= applies to me most of the time).  
* Higher scores indicate higher levels of psychological distress. \[[1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/view/174532), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6751677/), [5](https://f1000research.com/articles/12-229), [6](https://www.scielo.br/j/pusf/a/556FBTT3R47CFgxGqmL4Bbj/?format=pdf#:~:text=The%20DASS%2D21%20was%20developed%20by%20Lovibond%20and,dimensions%20\(Gomez%2C%202013;%20Osman%20et%20al.%2C%202012\).)\]

* Research on the DASS-21 in various African countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi have examined its psychometric properties, including reliability, validity and sensitivity. \[[1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/view/174532), [2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14330237.2019.1647499), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8385266/), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9128196/), [8](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-03994-0)\]  
* Studies have focused on assessing the DASS-21's ability to screen for common mental disorders and measure psychological distress in diverse populations, including working adults, medical students, postpartum women, and migrant returnees. \[[1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/view/174532), [2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14330237.2019.1647499), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8385266/), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9128196/), [8](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-03994-0)\]  
* Researchers have used the DASS-21 to explore psychological distress among specific groups, such as those experiencing workplace-related stress, mental health problems in returnees, and the impact of trauma. \[[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14330237.2019.1647499), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8385266/), [9](https://www.verywellmind.com/dass-21-depression-anxiety-scale-8697715#:~:text=Limitations%20and%20Other%20Considerations%20The%20DASS%2D21%20also,to\)%20obsessive%20compulsive%2Dtype%20disorders%2C%20trauma%2C%20or%20psychosis.)\]
